    "# Tutorial 5 - Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lectures, so far you have covered NLP processing of textual data and word embeddings. Therefore, in today's notebook we will revisit the algorithm Word2Vec (W2V) that you can use to learn word embeddings with two models, i.e., CBOW and Skip-Gram. While the two flavours of W2V differ in how they are modeling token embeddings, both models aim at producing dense numerical vector representations, that capture the semantic relationships in the input textual samples. Once we have covered how to create pretrained embedding dictionaries compatible with keras, we will generate two-dimensional representation of the trained word embeddings that is suitable for plotting purposes. Afterward, we will use the embeddings from W2V in an MLP-based network trained for sentiment classification. <br>\n",

    "In W2V, each word is represented by two vectors of dimension *𝑑*, as words take both roles, i.e., context and target word. The word vectors are the parameters of the neural network, which we train on our corpus of textual data for language modeling purposes. The goal is to learn low-dimensional, dense representation of words as numerical continuous vectors, which enable ML models to understand the meaning and the semantics of words algorithmically. Therefore, language modeling can be regarded as the upstream task, whereas, e.g., sentiment classification using the pretrained embeddings from W2V would be the downstream task. There are two variants of W2V, which we can use to obtain word embeddings: <br>\n",

    "The Continuous Bad of Word (CBOW) model differs from the Skip-Gram model mainly in that the former predicts the center word from surrounding context tokens, whereas the latter predicts the context from the center word. The surrounding words are quantified by defining a context window. In the above visualization, the context window is set to 2 tokens. The training process involves parsing the textual samples with context size 2, and sliding the training tuples consisting of inputs and targets until the end of the sentences. Language modeling does not necessitate target labels or text annotation, as the training inputs and outputs are obtained from parsing the textual samples. Thus, we call such training process self-supervised. W2V in its two flavours is trained with a shallow neural network. For simplicity purposes, assume you have a single token as the input and the following word as the target:<br>\n",

    "The input layer of the network represents a one-hot-vector, which has a positive value at the index of the input word. The dot product of the one-hot-vector with the continuous trainable weights of the shallow network amounts to indexing the vector of weights in the hidden layer associated with the input word *can*. This is also the vector of weights that we will use as our word embeddings in the downstream task. If we choose to train our own embeddings using W2V instead of downloading pretrained embeddings, then, first, we would have to clean our dataset. Thus, let's import the IMDB dataset, and clean it using our `NLP_preprocessing_pipeline` function from the previous tutorial notebook. While previously the function returned a list of cleaned tokens, in this notebook we will design our function to return the whole cleaned string of the textual samples, as we will later feed these cleaned strings to a `TextVectorization` layer from `keras`:<br>"

    "Next, we will build our vocabulary with the `TextVectorization` layer. The latter transforms the input strings to a list of integer token indices, which are associated with a unique word in our vocabulary. We learn the vocabulary by calling the function `adapt`. When the layer is adapted, it learns the frequency of the individual tokens in the dataset. If we specify a maximum size of our vocabulary, e.g., 15k, then the layer would create a vocabulary containing the 15k most frequently encountered words in the cleaned textual samples. Words outside of this vocabulary get mapped to the UNK-token, i.e., out-of-vocabulary token. For consistency purposes, we will also specify the maximal sequence length for each textual sample. For instance, if we set the sequence length to a maximum of 100 tokens, then textual samples with less tokens will get padded with zeros to a length of 100. Similarly to other preprocessing techniques that we have applied so far in this semester, the layer `TextVectorization` is adapted on the train set only. For this reason, we will split our cleaned data *X* into train and test set before the learning of the vocabulary takes place. "

    "## **2. Plotting Embeddings using t-SNE** (Exercise 1)<br>\n",
    "T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a tool to generate low dimensional data, e.g., in a 2D space, from high dimensional embeddings for visualization purposes. The transformation process of t-SNE preserves the structure of the data in the low dimensional space, which enables the interpretability of the original high dimensional vectors. `Sklearn` provides you with easy access to the implementation of t-SNE (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html). However, `sklearn`'s implementation is quite costly and can consume a lot of memory especially if the original data comes in a high dimensional space such as the embeddings from W2V. Therefore, in this task you will use a less computationally expensive version of t-SNE implemented in the package `openTSNE`. For this purpose, you would have to install the package with pip first. Once you have completed the installation of `openTSNE`, you are tasked with the following:<br>\n",
    "- take the first 500 samples from the cleaned `Xclean_train` dataset, and transform them with the `vectorize_layer` from the demo.\n",
    "- feed the vectorized output to the embedding layers containing the CBOW and Skip-Gram weights from the demo (`embedding_layer_cbow` and `embedding_layer_skipgram`), convert the Tensor to numpy format, and flatten the token sequences to obtain vectors of the dimensionality 300 (embedding dimension) * 100 (sequence length).\n",
    "- fit `TSNE` from `openTSNE` on the cbow and skip-gram embeddings, and store the resulting two components together with the target labels from the train set (`y_train`) in two dataframes. Name the columns of the dataframes X-Axis, Y-Axis and Sentiment Class.\n",
    "- use the package `seaborn` to plot two well-annotated scatter plots next to each other for each embedding type. Use the parameter hue from `seaborn`'s scatter plot to plot the relationship of the two-dimensional t-SNE embeddings to the sentiment class. You can check out some examples for plotting with seaborn under the following link: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html.  \n",
    "- provide a short interpretation of the visualization: what pattern do you observe? what could be causing this pattern? in which scenario would you observe a different pattern?   "
